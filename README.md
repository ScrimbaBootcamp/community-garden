# The Scrimba Bootcamp Community Garden

Scrimba Bootcamp students will contribute to this open source project, which will be our variation of a 'Digital Garden'. A digital garden can take many forms - it could be something like a wiki, a collection of links to interesting resources, code snippets, or maybe there are assets you use frequently in frontend projects (social media SVGs for example). In this project, each student may have their own little 'plot' on the page to share a few of these items and style it how they please.

[!NOTE]
This open source project is for Scrimba Bootcamp students to get experience working with other developers, becoming familiar with the git workflow, and learning best practices for collaborative projects. Right now we will not be assigning issues or accepting pull requests from anyone other than our students. 

 If you would like to contribute to this project, please read the Contributing Guidelines and our Code of Conduct. Our Contributing Guidelines will indicate that this project has Issues, to which students should request assignment before submitting their Pull Requests.
